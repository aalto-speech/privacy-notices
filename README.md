# Privacy Notices

This repository contains **static HTML privacy notices** for applications and research projects maintained by the Aalto ASR research group at Aalto University.

The pages are published using GitHub Pages so that each notice has a stable URL which can be referenced from apps, research plans, and other data application documents.

## Published pages

Currently, this repository includes the following privacy notices:

- [index.html](https://github.com/aalto-speech/privacy-notices/blob/main/index.html)  
  Landing page that lists links to all privacy notices in this repository.

- `saysvenska-privacy.html`  
  Privacy policy for the SaySvenska mobile application. (Not yet in this repo)

- [elfa-privacy.html](https://github.com/aalto-speech/privacy-notices/blob/main/elfa-privacy.html)  
  Privacy notice describing how the ELFA corpus is used in research by the Aalto ASR research group.    

Additional notices for other apps or projects can be added as separate `.html` files and linked from `index.html`.

## Usage

- Each privacy notice is a **standalone HTML page**.
- The pages are intended to be linked from:
  - mobile apps (e.g. “Privacy Policy” link in settings or app store listing),
  - corpus documentation (e.g. when describing how a corpus is used in a specific research project),
